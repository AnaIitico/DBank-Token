1. This was my first token deployment into the Kovan test network Mar-16-2021.  I've attached the Transaction link for token creation and deployment.

This was a part of a code challenge before I started to learn blockchain development.  The code was given to me and I had to modify the code with a given set of instructions on a pdf document.  Google and YouTube were my best tools since I had no clue what I was really doing.  I think the point of the challenge was to see if I would quit, or do whatever it took to learn and make it work.

This was the project that inspired me to learn blockchain development. I joined a coding bootcamp right after I passed this and have been on my journey ever since.
